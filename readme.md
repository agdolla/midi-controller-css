# Midi Controller Css

I type a lot of css, so I bought a Korg NanoKontrol 2 and built this lovely Atom package.
Each column of buttons controls the values of one css property, and each slider sets the px/percent/... values.

This package is not yet documented or published, it works but still in development and test.
It is also recommended to use with the [MarmWork](https://github.com/dimitrinicolas/marmwork) front-end framework.
